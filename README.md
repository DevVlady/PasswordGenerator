# Password_Generator

Description: In this platform, a user will have a random generated password based on the parameters they've chosen in the prompt alerts.

Instructions: A user is asked the click on the generate button which will then prompt them with the first parameter of the password requirement theyd like their password to contain. The frist parameter being a number of characters between 8 & 128. If the users chooses outside the parameters required, they are alerted with a popup message letting them know the parameters they've chosen are not within the requirement length. Following the length of characters the user is asked if they would like to have numbers, then uppercase letters, followed by lowercase letters and then finally if their password is to include any special characters. Once the user has completed their preffered selection of parameters they'd like included in their password, they are presented with a random generate password with their preference selection.

The technologies and programming languages used in this project are: HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript.
